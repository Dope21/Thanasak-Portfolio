        Due to the covid-19 in Thailand, people need to write their names on the paper before entering the building. 
        Me and my friend wanted to build a resident cards scanner to retrieve the information of the people who entered instead of writing on paper
        and uploading that infomation onto the database so people can check their timeline on the website.
